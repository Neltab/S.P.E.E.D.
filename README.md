## This game was done during the third Blackthornprod Game Jam.

### What is a Game Jam ?
A game jam is a sort of fun contest where you have to create something, mostly a game, on a defined theme, from scratch, in a certain amount of time.
There are plenty of Game Jams nowaday, the most famous being, in my opinion, the Ludum Dare where the Minecraft's prototype got created.

### The Blackthornprod's Game Jam
This game jam offered us a whole week to compete, which is a lot, most game jams last two or three days.
The theme for this week was "More is less".
It was quite hard to find a good idea on that theme that we could have done in only a week, considering we had to follow our engineering school's courses.
So we came out with a simple 3D platformer game. We mostly did 2D game when we learnt how to use Unity, our game engine, so we wanted to try new things.
Moreover, we did not only focus on gameplay elements, as we tried to discover as many new things as possible.

### What did we learnt thanks to this event
As a novice game maker I always wanted to simulate water. This dream began with Minecraft's shaders and got enhanced by Sea of Thieves' water.
I took advantage of the large amount of unused space and filled it with a shader based water.
